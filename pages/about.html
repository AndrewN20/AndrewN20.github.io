    <h1> About this Website </h1>
    <p> It has been a while since I worked on a website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
        I honestly rush this webiste to get exta credit.
        Some problems I have developing this webiste is relearning HTML/CSS/JavaScript and using Github pages.
        What I learn about Github pages is that when you type your URL, it seems to not show the actual pages of my work and instead links it to a diffent pages
        Github pages also messed up my linking on index.html.
        Overall, I have to relearn web development and fix these errors. </p>
